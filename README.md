## Project Overview

This project uses Machine Learning to predict who would win the 2021-2022 NBA MVP Award. We know that Nikola Jokic won the award, but I wanted to see if computers would make the same predictions and which variables factored most into the computer's decisions. This project utilized web scraping, data cleaning, and machine learning to make the final predictions. There are also some components of data visualization with the plotly library. 

### Project Workflow

- Scrape data from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) through the help of [DataQuest WebScraping Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/c/Dataquestio).
- Data cleaning, table aggregating, and feature engineering. 
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning for Regression analysis
- Building customized performance metrics for model predictions. 
- Utilizing backtesting to optimize model performance
- Data Visualization to explore model biases
- Trying an alternative model to Ridge Regression, Random Forest Regressor comparison.

### Project Questions
- Is Nikola Jokic the MVP in the eyes of computers?
- How is the Ridge Regression Model biased?
- Which statistics are most important in predicting MVP vote shares?
- Who was the real MVP?
